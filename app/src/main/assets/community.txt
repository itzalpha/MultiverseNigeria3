Verse Store's mission is to bring to users local apps in there environment , while also making them have access to different knowledge brought from different platform .It also host Verse City First Blog. We are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our growing community. Our Community Guidelines establish a set of norms and common code of conduct that provide for a safe and welcoming space for everyone.
At Verse Store, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity. We encourage users to share what makes them unique in skills and viewers to engage with what inspires them; we believe that a safe environment helps everyone do so openly. We aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by encouraging authentic content on Verse Store.
Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and everything on Verse Store. We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation, monitoring and aim to do so before people report potentially violative content to us. We also encourage our community members to report any content or account they believe violates our Community Guidelines, We do that by providing areas to report on stuffs, they interact with on the App.
We will remove any content – including posts, pictures, images, links, or other text – that violates our Community Guidelines. Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal them if they believe no violation has occurred. We will temporarily or permanently ban accounts and/or users that are involved in severe or repeated on-platform violations; we may also consider actions on other platforms and offline behavior in these decisions. Circumstances that involve any instance of a threat of real-world harm to human life that is specific, credible, and imminent may be reported to law enforcement authorities. The full Verse Store experience is for people 13 and older, and we actively remove accounts of people we suspect are under this age. Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind. For some content, we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results, or making videos ineligible for recommendation in the For You feed. More information can be found below in the Ineligible for the For You feed section.
At the same time, we recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines may be in the public interest. Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain limited circumstances.
We update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping Verse Store a safe place for creativity and joy.
